The program begins by asking the user if they are a new user or an existing user. If the user is new, the program prompts them to sign up by entering their name, CNIC, address, and initial balance. If the user is an existing user, they are prompted to enter their login credentials and their balance is retrieved.

After sign up/login, the user is presented with the game rules and their current balance. The user can then play the game, which involves guessing a number between 1 and 10. The program generates three random numbers between 1 and 10, and the user's guess is compared to each of the three numbers. If the user's guess matches any of the three numbers, they win double the amount they bet. If the user's guess does not match any of the three numbers, they lose the amount they bet.

The user can choose to play again or quit the game after each round. The game continues until the user runs out of money or chooses to quit. If the user chooses to quit, a 5% tax is deducted from their balance before the program terminates.

To use this code, you need to copy the code into a C++ development environment, such as Visual Studio or CodeBlocks, and compile it. Once the program is compiled, you can run it and follow the instructions provided by the program. Note that this program is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual gambling.
